## Qs
Why pair bytes and not characters?
- think vocabulary size, lookup tables

Why not compress the training data until no consecutive pairs found?
- probably due to desire to keep limited vocab size

How to determine vocab size?
- experimentation 

Does a larger vocabulary size make a model better? What are the pros / cons of a large vocabulary size? What are lookup tables?

I don't understand how lookup tables work. We'll get there .
